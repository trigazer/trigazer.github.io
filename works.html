<h1>My Works</h1>

<div class="worksc1">
	<h2>Scorching Glare</h2>
	<img src="assets/img/img6.png" width="40%"; height="40%";>
	<p class="description"> One of the projects I created in my Graphic Design III class, for this assissment we have to brainstorm our ideas and research on other similar artists' work for a better development of the final work,
	the image on the right is my final work. For the final work I've decided to only focus on the head of the dragon knight, using various brushes and tools to create the horns and the hairs. The software I choosed to use were Sketchbook Pro</p>

	<h2>Great Gatsby</h2>
	<img src="assets/img/img7.png" width="40%"; height="40%";>
	<p class="description"> One of my English PBL in junior year, for this project we have to create a study guide that contains the analysis of the book "Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. This is one of the visuals I created

	<h2>Freshman year Spring PBL</h2>
	<img src="assets/img/img8.jpg" width="40%"; height="40%";>
	<p class="description"> This is a design for the shirt so everything will be backwards, when it's printed on the shirt it will be displayed in the right way. For this project we have to help other kids that are unwealthy, it's a
	 collaboration of all freshman DA programs. Since I'm in web and some other group has no members that know how to draw digitally, I've to help other groups on their T-shirt designes, I traced the design they gave me and taught them
	 the basic use of pen tools for Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<div class="worksc1">
	<h2>Free Write: Loyalty</h2>
	<img src="assets/img/img9.jpg" width="20%"; height="20%";>
	<p class="description"> One of the free writing assignments I wrote in my English 11 class, loyalty is a value easily expressed, but often difficult to uphold. It's a strong bond between people, things
	, and events. We have to think about a time when our loyalty is tested, describe the situation and explain our decision. My example was really simple, I bought a second-hand 3ds on Ebay and I was really regret after
	being the highest bidder on the item, my loyalty on the contract between I and the seller were tested. In the end I did not buy the 3ds. It's a short 3 paragraph free write, I had a brief introduction on loyalty itself and
	then focused on describing the situation from beginning to the end.</p>

<div class="worksc1">
	<h2>English Final</h2>
	<p class="description">  August, First period on the first day of school. I walked into this classroom, figured that this class is not going be a easy class for me.
	Throughout the year until this day, the last day of my junior year classes. The thought still haven't faded, but I can ensure myself that I had became a better me as a writer.
	Different than the beginning , the mere little "me" has grown so much that I couldn't imagine I could ever be this good at writing. Things I learned this year are not measurable than what
	I've learned in the previous years. I've improved myself in organizing the structure of the sentence, less grammar issues, and a closer proofreading. Also I learned different types of writing such as persuasion, narrative, exemplification and description.</p>

  <p class="description">Not that what I learned in the previous aren't matter. They built up the basis for me to be more prepared in this class, that we don't have to went over when should we start a sentence with "because" or "but". That what exactly is "SOAPS" , a thesis statement. Instead we can go straight
  into the questions "what makes a story persuasive, the structure of the stanzas for romanticism, "objective" or "subjective" , meters and rhymes in a song.</p>
  
  <p class="description">The fact that I still haven't known anyone in depth in this class is the stain for me this year. I know that they're all good people but I didn't stepped up, always being inactive and quiet. I'll improve on that next year, also even though I'm getting better but grammar, organization issues still haven't dissolved. I also need to read faster. Overall I enjoyed this class, the fact I learned so much from Mr.Davis this year makes me happy. The indigenous and helpless feeling on some of the member in the class are already gone, sometimes we just have to shakes it off and move on. Knowledge and reasons I learned are not measurable, I've not only became a better writer, but a better myself.

	<img src="assets/img/moorenews.png" width="100%"; height="100%";>
	<p class="description"> The fake newspaper we were asked to create in our English sophomore class, that time we decided to make fun of the person who assigned us this project, Mr.Moore, you would guess that the name "Moore News" is based
	 on his name, you're wrong young man, totally wrong! not that our paper's name is based on him, but his name is based on our paper. Inside the newspaper is articles making fun of Mr.Moore and stupid advertisements like "Monster causes you to sleep more".</p>

	<h2>Zodiac Generator</h2>
	<img src="assets/img/img9.jpg" width="10%"; height="10%";>
	<p class="description"> One of the design I made for my AP computer Science class, the goal was to make a Zodiac Generator Program that generates user's horoscope based on their birthdate. Since it's our first year learning Java
	 our teacher wants us to create something really simple and easy to use based on our skills. I designed the user interface and the graphics for it, the chart in the middle demos the 12 zodiac signs, the order of the zodiac is based on the month
	 they represent.</p>

	<h2>Highschool Proficiency Practice Writing</h2>
	<img src="assets/img/img10.jpg" width="30%"; height="30%";>
	<p class="description"> A narrative essay based on the prompt our English teacher gave us. My handwriting confused my teacher so the "v" letter sometimes looks like an "r"(lol). I didn't proof read the writing before
	turning it in so the fluency and grammer has lots of issues. Although I do have a strong thesis statement in the essay, decent details and organizations. This practice helped me felt more prepared for the actual writing proficiency test.</p>

We have to find different pieces of images online and put them together to form a human-looking figure. I choosed different parts of automobile, the headlight, tires, doors, etc.
	 The final artwork looks more like a robot to me but hey, I'm proud of it. This assignment helped us getting a better idea with the different selection tools.</p>

	<h2>Dino Dino</h2>
	<img src="assets/img/dino.png" width="50%"; height="50%";>

	<h2>NAACP</h2>
	<img src="assets/img/naacp.png" width="50%"; height="50%";>
	<p class="description"> I haven't coded in monthes since senior year started. This job would be a good practice for me to get back to coding.... And that's what I thought before I get to know Wix, yes if you know Wix I used it in this project. The design for the NAACP has been done by my friends and I was asked to do the "coding" for
	the site, even though Wix doesn't involve that much coding. Compared to other site the one has been quite easy for me to do thanks to all the skills I've learned previously. NAACP is a organization created for colored people and fighting for their equality in U.S.. As an immigrant it was a pleasure to re-design and program their website</p>

<div class="worksc2">
	<h2>Marco's Pizza</h2>
	<img src="assets/img/pizza.jpg" width="60%"; height="60%";>
	<p class="description"> First client work I got in Studio C, We were asked to created 3 digital menus for Marco's Pizza, chain restaurant across the town. I was assigned to the 3rd menu which contains the most information compared to the other two. So it'll be quite boring and contains large amount of texts compare to the others.
	But I made it quite interesting and put some elements that would surprise the customers. On top-right there's a slideshow that will display all the sides that's on the menu, thanks to our amazing coding team that could be done very easily. It looks pretty fire in their local store, ready to order some?</p>

	<h2>CCSD Risk Management</h2>
	<img src="assets/img/ccsd.png" width="50%"; height="50%";>
	<p class="description"> Not really much instruction given to me on this job, Simply I was asked to do 8 icons for the app we'll be creating: CCSD Risk Management. I've been creating icons and buttons for years but this time it was something different. For example 2 buttons, Hard and Soft Lockdown. First of all what the hell are those!?
	This is the challenge of this job, I don't even know what I'm creating. So I put down the thoughts with my friends and comes up with a general idea of where I'm going with the design and created from there. The product are as shown in the picture.</p>

	To make it look more interesting to students who wants to learn more about their teachers I made various colors based on the theme of the website when hovers on one of the teachers.

	<h2>Senior Capstone</h2>
	<img src="assets/img/capstone.png" width="70%"; height="70%";>
	<p class="description"> So much space I have to talk about my capstone that took 2 people 9 month to complete. This year's topic was "do whatever you want but meaningful to the community" Our idea was to create an website that contains all 11 major food allergens that could cause sickness and death.
	 To let students and teachers know how harmful they could be if not treated in the correct way. First was the content writing, we put tons of researches on each categories and put them on a manner much like how we want them to look like on the actuall page, after it was approved by an allergie professional
	 we get to move on to the designing phase. I did most of the design so I could talk more about it, our design is aimed to grab children's attention first sight when they look at the site. But also not going to completely driving adults away due to bright texts and graphics. The banner was inspired by a food cube
	 picutre I saw a long time ago. At the end the capstone has been really successful and it marked a huge page in my high school career.</p>
