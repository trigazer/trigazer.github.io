<h1>My Works</h1>

	<img src="assets/img/img6.png" width="20%"; height="20%";>
	<p class="description"> One of the projects I created in my Graphic Design III class, for this assissment we have to brainstorm our ideas and research on other similar artists' work for a better development of the final work,
	the image on the right is my final work. For the final work I've decided to only focus on the head of the dragon knight, using various brushes and tools to create the horns and the hairs.</p>

	<img src="assets/img/img7.png" width="20%"; height="20%";>

<div class="works">
	<h2>Freshman year Spring PBL</h1>
	<img src="assets/img/img8.jpg" width="20%"; height="20%";>
	<p class="description"> This is a design for the shirt so everything will be backwards, when it's printed on the shirt it will be displayed in the right way. For this project we have to help other kids that are unwealthy, it's a
	 collaboration of all freshman DA programs. Since I'm in web and some other group has no members that know how to draw digitally, I've to help other groups on their T-shirt designes, I traced the design they gave me and taught them
	 the basic use of pen tools for Adobe Illustrator.</p>
