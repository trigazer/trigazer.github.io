<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>	So a little introduction about myself, my name is Sky. I am a designer or more accurate to say a web designer. Think is my favorite thing to do because it takes 0 energy away from me and I can do it whenever I want.
It gives me new ideas all the time and when I think that it's a good idea, I will draw it down. I like to draw, it's part of my life, I draw on everything paper, sketch book, english notebook, ground using a stick, computers,
everywhere! On computers I draw with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, I think they're easy to use because I learned how to use them in school.I get new ideas from animes I watch and books I read(must be fiction or have pictures otherwise I'll have a really hard time to read them).
In 2011, the counselor in Southwest CTA came to my middle school and showed me this awsome chance to knew and learn about web design, I think it changed my life at some point.
</p>

<p>	Music plays a big part of my life, if you know me in real life you will see me always carry a pair of earbuds everytime I'm outside. I like to listen to R&B, rock, J/K pop music. Music is my driving force of almost everything, they
 often give me strength and power. I also like card games such as Cardfight Vanguard and Battle spirits, the artwork of the cards often give me my new ideas on my own designs. </p>
